# ActivityPulse

Have you ever wondered where your time really goes?

You sit at your computer, the hours pass, and at the end of the day... you're not quite sure what happened. Maybe you feel productive. Maybe not. But how do you really know?

I found myself asking the same question — every single day.

So I built **ActivityPulse**.

### 🧠 What is ActivityPulse?

ActivityPulse is a lightweight Windows desktop app that helps you **see your day clearly**.

It quietly tracks your active applications, monitors your status (active, idle), and shows you exactly where your time was spent — all without intruding, slowing down your system, or stealing your attention.

No setup. No manual input. No distractions. 

Think of it like a fitness tracker — but for your focus.

### 🔍 What it shows you

Open the dashboard and you'll see:

- Which apps you used today  
- How long each app was active  
- Whether you were active, idle — minute by minute  
- A clean visual summary of your time  

It’s local-only. Your data stays with you. No tracking, no accounts.

### 🙋‍♂️ Why I built it

Because I wanted to **spend my time better** — not just feel busy.  
ActivityPulse was born from curiosity, refined by need, and built with care.
